# MATLAB Generator *for OpenAPI*

This package provides both a MATLAB client as well as a MATLAB server generator for APIs defined using the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

Both generators depend on the same Java libraries which need to be provisioned first; see [](./GettingStarted.md) to learn more.

More details on how to use the generators and the generated code can be found in the following sections:
